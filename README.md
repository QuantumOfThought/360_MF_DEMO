## Quick Start

### Option 1: Using Local Server (Recommended)
Double-click `START_SERVER.bat` to launch the application with a local web server.

### Option 2: Direct File Access
Open `index.html` directly in your browser. Note: Some browsers may block image loading due to security restrictions.

## Troubleshooting

If the 360° image doesn't load:
1. Check the browser console (F12) for error messages
2. Verify the file `images/IMG_20260202_165406_816.JPG` exists
3. Use the local server method (START_SERVER.bat)
